OGS 32" RC/SBIG STL-11000M FITS files (Ready for Processing)

Nine new image file sets posted on March 15, 2009

Listed below are links to FITS files for several of the data sets I have taken
with the Optical Guidance Systems 32" Ritchey-Chretien Telescope and SBIG
STL-11000m CCD camera.

These files will only be of interest to astronomical imagers who have the
proper software to complete the processing of the images.

The files have been calibrated (dark subtracted, flat fielded, stacked, and
aligned). They are ready for RGB combine and/or LRGB or HaLRGB combine in the
program of your choice. The R/G/B filters used for all data were the SBIG set.
I've experimented with various RGB color combine ratios, and my current
starting ratios for the SBIG filters are R:G:B = 1.3 : 1.0 : 1.6. The H-Alpha
images were taken with the Astrodon 6nm filter.

Feel free to download these files and try your hand at processing images taken
with a large scope under dark skies.

Should you decide to publish any resulting processed image (on a web site or
in print), the only thing I ask is that the credit line include the phrase
"Image Acquisition by Jim Misti".

You should be able to download each file by right-clicking on the file name,
then selecting "Save Target As" (Internet Explorer) or "Save Link Target As"
(Netscape) and then specifying a location on your PC to save the file.

Each file is just over 20meg in size. If you don't have a broadband connection
but would like to receive the files on cd-rom, please send a stamped (6
ounces), self-addressed envelope of at least 6x9" size to

Jim Misti
22 Susanna Way
Newtown, PA 18940
USA.

Unless I'm overwhelmed by cd-rom requests, I'll provide these at no cost to
the requestor.
